                       <p> I'm a fullstack web designer with extensive knowledge and experience in building web applications
                        using Javascript, ReactJs, HTML, CSS, and bootstrap.</p>

                        <p>I define myself by the work I want to do. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and 
                        do interesting things that matter. I'm never satisfied to just come up with ideas, instead I have an impulsive 
                        need to act on them.</p>

                        <p>Fueled by this boundless enthusiasm, I am easily inspired, love interacting with humans and love to develop 
                        expertise in a number of areas over my course of life and career.</p>

                        <p>I design web applications that are responsive on both mobile and desktop 
                        platform and have been working in the field for almost 2 years now.</p>

                        <p>I would Love to help you take your product to the next level.</p>
